This is basically normal defuse mode except that players leave
Dogtags when they die which can either be picked up by Allies which allows them to respawn or Enemies who then cannot respawn until the round ends. Its RECOMMENDED to play this mode on de_ maps. Also recommended to alter the mp_roundtime cvar.
